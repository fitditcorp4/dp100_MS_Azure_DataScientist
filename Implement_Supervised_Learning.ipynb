    "# Project Problem\n",
    "Your family has managed Washington State's longest-running elk farm for several generations, but the health of your herd has slowly worsened for decades. It's well known that your farm's breed of elk should not be fed grain when nightly temperatures average above freezing (32°F or 0°C). For that reason, you've always followed your grandfather's farming calendar and switched from grain feed after January 31.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've recently read about climate change affecting farming practices. Could this explain the poorer health of elk in recent years? With some historical weather data at your side, you seek to determine whether local temperatures have changed from your grandfather's day, and whether your farming calendar needs to be updated."
