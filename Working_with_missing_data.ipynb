    "Scenario: the last voyage of the Titanic\n",
    "As an eager marine archaeologist, you have an unusually keen interest in maritime disasters. Late one night while scrolling between images of whale bones and ancient scrolls about Atlantis, you come across a public dataset listing people known to be on the Titanic during its first – and last – voyage. Captured by the balance between fate and chance, you ponder – what were the factors that dictated whether a person survived this famous shipwreck? Data from this period are slightly patchy – a lot of information for certain passengers is unknown. You’ll need to find ways to patch up this data before analyzing it in full."
