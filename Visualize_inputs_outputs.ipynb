    "# Exercise: Datasets in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we loaded some data and fit a model to it. Several aspects of this were simplified, particularly that the data was hard-coded into our python script, and we didn't spend any time really looking at the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll load data from a file, filter it, and graph it. Doing so is a very important first step in order to build proper models, or to understand their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, there's no need to edit any code in the examples in this unit. Try to read it, understand it, then press the **Run** button to run it. As always, it's vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load data with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are large variety of libraries that help you work with data. In Python, one of the most common is _Pandas_. We used pandas briefly in the previous exercise. Pandas can open data saved as text files and store it in an organized table called a `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's open some text data that's stored on disk. Our data is saved in a file called `doggy-boot-harness.csv`."
